        description2: "My first tasks as an analyst included water analysis (TOC and conductivity) but I soon joined a particle inspection laboratory where I mainly worked with a Malvern Morphologi G2 (later upgraded to G3) digital microscope to determine particle size distributions and morphological parameters of APIs. ",

This was the first time I worked with Sciex and Thermo triple quadrupole mass spectrometers coupled with Agilent HPLCs and Shimadzu UHPLCs.",
        description2: "Besides performing method development, validations and sample analysis for large clinical studies (2–3000 samples each), I gained insights into data evaluation via performing PK calculations (NCA, IVIVC and BE) and basic level PK modelling with Phoenix WinNonlin.",

        description1: "I wanted to enhance my knowledge in an environment where I can see how some of the best labs of the industry work, so I decided to continue my career in the UK. I worked there between January 2016 and August 2020 at multiple CROs: LGC, Envigo (now Covance), ABS Laboratories, and finally Pharmaron. During this period, I had the chance to gain insights into most bits of nonclinical research, including in vitro and ADME work, as well as a wide range of toxicity studies.",
        description2: "I have hands-on experience as senior scientist and study director. In my latest role, I was a senior technical specialist. The projects I was involved in were mainly GLP regulated but there were nonreg and GCP studies, as well as work according to SANCO (chemicals). My tasks involved method development, validation and sample analysis (including tissue and formulation analysis).",
        description3: "In the UK, I gained experience with a wide range of mass spectrometers: AB Sciex triple quads and QTRAPs (4000–5000–5500–6500+), Waters Xevo TQ-S triple quads, which were coupled to various LCs and autosamplers, including Agilent HPLCs and UHPLCs, Jasco UHPLC pumps, CTC autosamplers, AB Sciex (Shimadzu) Nexera UHPLCs, and of course, Waters Acquity (I-Class) UPLCs.",
