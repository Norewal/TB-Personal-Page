        description1: "I wanted to enhance my knowledge further so I decided to find a bioanalytical job in the UK. I worked there between January 2016 and August 2020 at multiple CROs: LGC, Envigo (now Covance), ABS Laboratories, and finally Pharmaron. During this period, I had the chance to gain insights into most bits of nonclinical research, including in vitro and ADME work, as well as a wide range of toxicity studies.",
        description2: "I had various positions, including senior scientist and study director, and my last role was senior technical specialist at Pharmaron. The projects I was involved in were mainly GLP regulated but there were also nonreg and GCP studies, as well as tissue and formulation analysis, and some SANCO (chemical) work.",
        description3: "During working in the UK, I had the chance to work with a wide range of LC-MS systems (AB Sciex 4000–5000–5500–6500+ triple quads, 4000 and 5500 QTRAPs, and Waters Xevo TQ-S triple quads, Agilent HPLCs and 1290 UHPLCs and CTC autosamplers, Jasco UHPLC pumps, AB Sciex (Shimadzu) Nexera UHPLCs, and of course, Waters Acquity (I-Class) UPLCs.",

        description2: "",
        description3: "Besides performing method development, validations and sample analysis for large clinical studies (2–3000 samples each), I gained insights into data evaluation via performing PK calculations (NCA and BE) and basic level PK modelling with Phoenix WinNonlin.",
